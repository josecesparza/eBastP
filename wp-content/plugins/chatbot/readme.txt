= How do I add new conversations to the ChatBot? =
Without DialogFlow: You can create simple text conversations with the <strong>[Conversational Form Builder](https://wordpress.org/plugins/conversational-forms/)</strong> addon by using the HTML elements to dislay your responses. The adoon does not yet support Conditional responses. We plan to add that feature soon. But for now, you can create linear conversations and display them from the Start menu. Once you have created a form using the Conversational form builder addon you can add it to the ChatBot start menu from the WPBot Settings->Start Menu. Make sure to always Save the ChatBot Start menu settings after rearranging the columns.

With DialogFlow: You can create new Intents and Text responses inside DialogFlow. For each user input, WPBot will automatically connect to DialogFlow and try to match with the Itents and training Data you added. When an Intent is matched, its response will be returned to the user.
